          <br/>
          <br/>
          We will build on the success of the two previous roundtables, organized in Geneva prior to the World Health Assembly (2). This year, we hope to come up with a road map for measuring outcomes and identifying bottlenecks over the year to come. Based on selected case studies, we will provide a source of guidance through an exchange of best practices within our network. Our upcoming roundtable is well-timed because of the innovative partnerships and technologies that are increasingly available. In addition, the international community is currently assessing the progress on the MDGs (Millennium Development Goals) toward eliminating cervical cancer by 2030. Joining efforts, with existing resources and knowledge, along with innovative initiatives and new partners, we should accelerate action and break this deep injustice that poorest women are facing as widely affected by this disease of the ancient times.

  				GHO events aim at building a better understanding of how partnerships and innovations can help extend capacity building, scaling up, access to healthcare and prevention, and benefit women’s health in particular. GHO events help instigate change and implement innovative global health projects that are accessible to those in greatest needs. They are also intended to serve as a model for creating dialogue and promoting the development of successful initiatives in Low and Middle Income Countries, LMC, as well in developed countries.  
				<br/>
				As a result, we hope our events have the potential to achieve significant improvements globally as well as locally, creating networks, South -South and South -North, for sharing experiences, pooling resources and best practices.

  				The exchange of experiences between all stakeholders on cervical cancer advancing strategies towards its elimination has never been so critical. We are now at a turning point: we have the technology and are coming forth with a new vision, new partnerships and a clear assessment for evaluating progress. In addition, the many global initiatives in women’s health are advancing the entire concept. Increasingly, cross-sector approaches facilitate cost effective strategies through HIV-HPV co-infection or HPV- Reproductive Health. The integration of HPV into existing programs and services also provides new opportunities for all to start making women’s health a key component in reducing poverty and gender issues.

      <h3>Why Cervical Cancer</h3>
      <p>
      	Our events are designed to be consistent with the SDG objectives through exchanges of experiences and support to constructive action in the field. They are enriched by players from the public and the private sector, including political-decision makers, international and African experts, implementers and researchers, with a specific focus on Africa.
      	<br/>
The healthcare topics range from how to reinforce local capacity building for implementing national cancer control policies to how to turn the innovative approaches into sustainable actions against chronic diseases, especially cervical cancer, and more specifically, uptake of HPV vaccination, HPV screening, capacity building and community mobilization, among others.
<br/>
Thus, our events will also serve two purposes to provide:
<br/>
&bull; INFORMATION on the current evidence on the different modalities and approaches, as well as to extend access to a comprehensive and practical review of best practices, as a source of reference.<br/>
&bull; CONTRIBUTIONS from all stakeholders on their current situation on cervical cancer control and prevention: what they consider as ideal ways to do it, obstacles they face, and suggestions to overcome them.
<br/>
<br/>
As for the following:
<br/>
<strong>Resources</strong>: Our website will provide evidence-based data and information on the different modalities and approaches to develop a comprehensive cervical cancer program at various levels. It will also provide an overview of the current situation of cervical cancer control and prevention in various countries: their challenges and expectations to move forward.<br/>
<strong>Collaboration</strong>: Ensuring access to healthcare, GHO is committed to working collaboratively with governments, health professionals, international partners and NGOs to facilitate prevention programs, to protect girls and women from cervical cancer, especially in low income settings. <br/>
<strong>Best practices</strong>: Ideally, a combination of HPV vaccination programs together with effective screening and treatment for precancerous lesions has the greatest potential to significantly reduce the burden of cervical cancer. Each country has its own experience, with a specific burden of cervical cancer, economic status, political background, cultures, status of women's rights, and resources available for cervical cancer control. However, exchanges at the regional level show that challenges are quite similar, and it is possible to learn from each other's experience into finding innovative solutions and partnerships.
<br/>
One of the key issues includes HPV vaccine introduction as a major tool for reducing the cervical cancer burden. Experience shows that it is programmatically feasible, financially sustainable and cost-effective. With the introduction of prophylactic vaccines against the oncogenic HPV 16 and HPV 18, with high coverage, about 70% of cervical cancer should be prevented worldwide if administered prior to exposure to infection. 
<br/>
With respect to secondary prevention, different screening methods, technologies, and strategies are developing to meet the challenges of improving their sensitivity, specificity, affordability, feasibility, acceptance, and compliance.  These are all areas in full evolution that require appropriate and constantly updated information, and field experience’s outcomes, to help informed decision-making.

          This second round table on cervical cancer is designed to give a sense of continuity to our exchanges, creating a place for enhancing experiences and ideas. It will also help better measure progress and create synergies and collaborations with the political leadership needed to move forward.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          - The annual convening of the event is very appropriate to the disease that is preventable, curable and cost effective.  As a matter of fact, moving forward is possible considering that:

  				GHO event aims at building a better understanding of how partnerships and innovations can help extend capacity building, scaling up, access to healthcare and prevention, and benefit women’s health in particular. 
  				<br/>
				GHO events help instigate change and implement innovative global health projects that are accessible to those in greatest needs. They are also intended to serve as a model for creating dialogue and promoting the development of successful initiatives in Low and Middle Income Countries, LMC, as well in developed countries.  
				<br/>
				As a result, we hope our events have the potential to achieve significant improvements globally as well as locally, creating networks, South -South and South -North, for sharing experiences, pooling resources and best practices. 
				<br/>
        <br/>
				New initiatives include the following: 
        <br/>
				&bull; Cervical cancer in the African French Speaking countries<br/>
				&bull; Women’s health, innovative approaches and technologies<br/>
				&bull; HIV-HPV interaction<br/>

  				The exchange of experiences between all stakeholders on cervical cancer advancing strategies towards its elimination has never been so critical. We are now at a turning point: we have the technology and are coming forth with a new vision, new partnerships and a clear assessment for evaluating progress. In addition, the many global initiatives in women’s health are advancing the entire concept. Increasingly, cross-sector approaches facilitate cost effective strategies through HIV-HPV co-infection or HPV- Reproductive Health. The integration of HPV into existing programs and services also provides new opportunities for all to start making women’s health a key component in reducing poverty and gender issues.

      <h3>Why Cervical Cancer</h3>
      <p>
      	Our events are designed to be consistent with the SDG objectives through exchanges of experiences and support to constructive action in the field. They are enriched by players from the public and the private sector, including political-decision makers, international and African experts, implementers and researchers, with a specific focus on Africa.
      	<br/>
The healthcare topics range from how to reinforce local capacity building for implementing national cancer control policies to how to turn the innovative approaches into sustainable actions against chronic diseases, especially cervical cancer, and more specifically, uptake of HPV vaccination, HPV screening, capacity building and community mobilization, among others.
<br/>
Thus, our events will also serve two purposes to provide:
<br/>
&bull; INFORMATION on the current evidence on the different modalities and approaches, as well as to extend access to a comprehensive and practical review of best practices, as a source of reference.<br/>
&bull; CONTRIBUTIONS from all stakeholders on their current situation on cervical cancer control and prevention: what they consider as ideal ways to do it, obstacles they face, and suggestions to overcome them.
<br/>
<br/>
As for the following:
<br/>
<strong>Resources</strong>: Our website will provide evidence-based data and information on the different modalities and approaches to develop a comprehensive cervical cancer program at various levels. It will also provide an overview of the current situation of cervical cancer control and prevention in various countries: their challenges and expectations to move forward.<br/>
<strong>Collaboration</strong>: Ensuring access to healthcare, GHO is committed to working collaboratively with governments, health professionals, international partners and NGOs to facilitate prevention programs, to protect girls and women from cervical cancer, especially in low income settings. <br/>
<strong>Best practices</strong>: Ideally, a combination of HPV vaccination programs together with effective screening and treatment for precancerous lesions has the greatest potential to significantly reduce the burden of cervical cancer. Each country has its own experience, with a specific burden of cervical cancer, economic status, political background, cultures, status of women's rights, and resources available for cervical cancer control. However, exchanges at the regional level show that challenges are quite similar, and it is possible to learn from each other's experience into finding innovative solutions and partnerships.
<br/>
One of the key issues includes HPV vaccine introduction as a major tool for reducing the cervical cancer burden. Experience shows that it is programmatically feasible, financially sustainable and cost-effective. With the introduction of prophylactic vaccines against the oncogenic HPV 16 and HPV 18, with high coverage, about 70% of cervical cancer should be prevented worldwide if administered prior to exposure to infection. 
<br/>
With respect to secondary prevention, different screening methods, technologies, and strategies are developing to meet the challenges of improving their sensitivity, specificity, affordability, feasibility, acceptance, and compliance.  These are all areas in full evolution that require appropriate and constantly updated information, and field experience’s outcomes, to help informed decision-making.
